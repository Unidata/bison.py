<h2 class="break"><a name="Introduction"><u>Introduction</u></a></h2>

The goal of this project is allow the use of <i>Bison</i>
to generate parsers for Python.
The Gnu Bison system (http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)
is an extremely powerful compiler generator system.
In its recent incarnations, it has been extended
from its original C orientations to support the
generation of additional parsers in C++ and Java.
This project extends that support to include Python.
<p>
Ideally, the Python support would be included
in the standard Bison distribution. That would
entail, however, that the Bison development team
have Python experience and the resources to support
Python. Neither of these is true, so this project
makes Python support available independent of the
Bison project.
<p>
A final note: why do this project?
The primary reason is to principled support for SAX parsing
in python. See
<a href="https://github.com/Unidata/yax.git">
https://github.com/Unidata/yax.git</a>
for a discussion of the <i>yax</i> project.

<h2 class="break"><a name="skeleton"><u>The Python Skeleton</u></a></h2>
The file "python.skel" is the key piece of software provided by this distribution.
Given <i>python.skel</i>, one can take a standard Bison grammar file, "grammar.y", say,
and create a python module capable of parsing input according to that grammar.
The module is created using a command such as this.
<pre>
    bison -Spython.skel grammar.y
</pre>
The remainder of this document describes how to use the module
and some of the quirks in using it.

<h2 class="break"><a name="misc"><u>Miscellaneous notes</u></a></h2>

There are a number of miscellaneous things to note about using python.skel.
<ul>
<li> The Bison language directive such "%language "python" should
not be used because it is not recognized by the underlying Bison
system. Using the "-Spython.skel" flag will guarantee that the correct
language (i.e. python) will be used.
<p>
<li> GLR parsers are currently unsupported in Python.  Do not use the
"glr-parser" directive.
<p>
<li> No header file can be generated for Python parsers.  Do not use the
"%defines" directive or the "-d"/"--defines" options.
<p>
<p>
<li> The current Python interface is experimental and may evolve.
Any suggestions for improvement to the generated parser are welcome.
</ul>

<h2 class="break"><a name="Python Parser Structure"><u>Python Parser Structure</u></a></h2>

Python presents some significant challenges for bison.  Bison has the
notion of a C-like language built deeply into its code, and python
violates a number of those notions.
<p>
The most important difference is that line indentation has
syntactic and semantic significance.  Effort has been
expended to ensure that this is not a significant problem:
if a piece of code is written and is legitimate python, then
is should work correctly inside the grammar file.  It is
possible, however, that something could be incorrectly
indented. If indentation errors occur when compiling the
parser, the grammar writer must be prepared to examine the
generated python code and adjust the indentation in the
bison .y file.
<p>
There are, however, some heuristics that can help.
<ul>
<li>Never use tabs except insidestring constants.
<p>
<li> Assume that the code inside a "%code" or "%code qualifier" is at
     indent level zero (0). It will be properly indented as needed.
<p>
<li> Single line actions (e.g. "{$$=...}") should cause no problems.
<p>
<li> Multiple line actions can be indented as desired, but note that
     every line of the action will automatically  be indented by 4
     blanks.
</ul>
In python code, line breaks can also have syntactic and semantic
significance. This should not be problem as long as your code is legal
python.
<p>
The python skeleton was derived from the Java skeleton, but there
are many differences.
Python treats a python file as defining a "module" (i.e. a
single file) with an associated scope. In effect, the module
is the equivalent of the Java parser class. This means that
most definitions in the python module (the file) are at the
outer scope. This means that no inner class definitions are
used. In particular, the "%token"s are defined as constants
in the module and not, as in Java, in the Lexer class.
Further, any lexer defined using "%code lexer {...}" is
installed in a top level class; it is not an inner class.

<h2 class="break"><a name="Python Bison Interface"><u>Python Bison Interface</u></a></h2>

Generating a Python parser from, say, "BASENAME.y", creates
a single Python source file named "BASENAME.py" that
contains the complete parser implementation.  Using a
grammar file without a ".y" suffix is currently broken (a Bison bug).  The
basename of the parser implementation file can be changed by
the "%file-prefix" directive or the "-p&lt;name-prefix&gt;"
command line option.  The entire parser implementation file name can be
changed by the "%output" directive or the "-o"&lt;output-file-name&gt;"
command line option.  The parser implementation file contains a single
module for the parser.
<p>
Like the Java parsers, Python parsers maintain the state of the
parser local to an instance of the parser class.  Therefore, all Python
parsers are "pure", and the "%pure-parser" and "%define api.pure"
directives do nothing when used in Python.
<p>
Currently, support for tracing is always compiled in.  Thus the
"%define parse.trace" and "%token-table" directives and the
"-t"/"--debug" and "-k"/"--token-table" options have no effect.  This
may change in the future to eliminate unused code in the generated
parser, so use "%define parse.trace" explicitly if needed.  Also, in
the future the "%token-table" directive might enable a public interface
to access the token names and codes.

<h2 class="break"><a name="Python Semantic Values"><u>Python Semantic Values</u></a></h2>

Python is a dynamically typed language, so there is no "%union"
directive in Python parsers.  The "%type" or "%token" directives may be
used to help bison do type checking, but they are not reflected in the
generated code.  An important consequence is that type checking occurs
at execution time.
<p>
The python semantic stack is declared to have members of any type.
which means that the types you specify can be anything.
<p>
Python parsers do not support "%destructor". This may eventually
change to use the python "del" statement, but until then, and as with
any other python program, the programmer has to be careful to avoid
circular references.
<p>
In addition, python parsers do not support "%printer", as
"__str__()" or the "str()" builtin function can be used to print the
semantic values.  This however may change (in a backwards-compatible
way) in future versions.

<h2 class="break"><a name="Python Location Values"><u>Python Location Values</u></a></h2>

When the directive "%locations" is used, the Python parser supports
location tracking. An auxiliary
user-defined class defines a "position", a single point in a file;
Bison itself defines a class representing a "location" as a range
composed of a pair of positions (possibly spanning several files).  The
name is "Location" by default, and may also be renamed using
<quote>"%define api.location.type {CLASS-NAME}"</quote>.
<p>
The Location class treats the position as a completely opaque value.
By default, the class name is "Position", but this can be changed with
<quote>"%define api.position.type {CLASS-NAME}"</quote>.
This class must be supplied by the user.
<p>
The Location class is defined this way.
<pre>
class Location:
  # User varadic init to do what in Jave would use multiple constructors
  def __init__ (self, *argv) :
    if (len(argv) == 0) :
      self.begin = None
      self.end = self.begin
    elif (len(argv) == 1) :
      self.begin = argv[0]
      self.begin = self.begin
    else :
      self.begin = argv[0]
      self.end = argv[1]
  # end __init__

  # Print a representation of the location.
  def __str__ (self) :
    if (self.begin == self.end) :
      return str(self.begin)
    else :
      return str(self.begin) + '-' + str(self.end)
# end class Location
</pre>
Note that for "__str__()" to work properly, the
position class should override the "__eq__" and "__ne__"
methods appropriately.

<h2 class="break"><a name="Python Parser Interface"><u>Python Parser Interface</u></a></h2>

The name of the generated parser class defaults to "YYParser".  The
"YY" prefix may be changed using the "%name-prefix" directive or the
"-p"/"--name-prefix" option.  Alternatively, use
<quote>"%define parser_class_name {NAME}"</quote>
to give a custom name to the class.  The superclass of the
parser class can be specified with the <quote>"%define extends"</quote>
directive.
<p>
The Python module name is, of course, defined by the output file name.
<p>
Except for the module defined class, "Location" and the
members described in the interface below, all the other
members and fields are preceded with a "yy" or "YY" prefix
to avoid clashes with user code.
<p>
The arguments to the parser class can be extended using the
"%parse-param" directive. Each occurrence of the directive will add a
field to the parser class"s "__init__" function.
<p>
The signatures  of the parser class externally used methods are
as follows.
<pre>
class YYParser:
  def __init__ (self, yylexer | lex_param, [parse_param]):
    ...

  def parse(self):
    ...

  def  yyerror(self, [location,] msg):
    ...

  def getErrorVerbose(self):
     ...

  def setErrorVerbose(self, tf):
    ...

  def getDebugStream(self):
     ...

  def setDebugStream(self, stream):
    ...

  def getDebugLevel(self):
     ...

  def setDebugLevel(self, level):
    ...
#end class YYParser
</pre>
The YYParser methods have the following semantics.
<dl>
<dt>def __init__ (self, yylexer | lex_param, [parse_param]):
<dd>
Constructor for YYParser.
Recall that
python allows only a single class constructor.  The defined named
parameters are as follows.
<ol>
<li> self &mdash; This is a python cliche argument required for all class
methods.
<li> yylexer &mdash; Specify the yylex object. If "%code lexer{...}"
is specified, then this argument will be replaced with
any specifications of "%lex-param {param}".
<li> parse_param &mdash; Specify the parse parameter(s) (if any).
There are no other parameters, unless "%param"s and/or
"%parse-param"s and/or "%lex-params" are used.
</ol>
<p>
<dt> def parse(self):
<dd>Run the syntactic analysis, and return "True" on success, other wise return "False".
<p>
<dt> def  yyerror(self, [location,] msg):
<dd>
Print an error message using the "yyerror" method defined in the
Lexer instance given to the parser.  The second argument is only
defined if the "%locations" directive is specified and specifies a
location for the error.  It may be of (dynamic) type "Location".
<p>
<dt> def getErrorVerbose(self):
<dt> def setErrorVerbose(self, tf):
<dd>
Get or set the option to produce verbose error messages.  These
are only available with "%define parse.error verbose", which also
turns on verbose error messages.
<p>
<dt> def getDebugStream(self):
<dt> def setDebugStream(self, stream):
<dd>
Get or set the stream used for tracing the parsing.  It defaults to
"sys.stderr".
<p>
<dt> def getDebugLevel(self):
<dt> def setDebugLevel(self, level):
<dd>
Get or set the tracing level.  Currently its value is either 0, no
trace, or nonzero, full tracing.
</dl>

<h2 class="break"><a name="Python Scanner Interface"><u>Python Scanner Interface</u></a></h2>

As previously noted, the constants for the user-defined token names
and the predefined "EOF" token are defined at the "module" level.

The YYParser class must have an instance of "class Lexer".
The lexer object can be provided in one
of two ways.
<ol>
<li> The user can define a subclass of the class Lexer and pass
an instance of it to the parser class.
<li> The user can define the body of the Lexer class using the
<quote>%code lexer {...}</quote> directive.
</ol>
<p>
The interface to the Lexer class differs from e.g. Java in that it
has only two primary methods (plus the location methods).
<ul>
<li> def yylex(self) --&gt; (int,Object): <br>
     Python allows the return of multiple values, so a call to "yylex"
     returns a two element tuple containing first the token (an
     integer) and second the lval (an arbitrary python value).
<p>
<li> def yyerror (self,[location,]msg): <br>
     This function is defined by the user to emit an error message.
     The "location" parameter is omitted if location tracking is not
     active.
<p>
<li> def getStartPos(self):<br>
     def getEndPos(self):<br>
     (Optional) As with the Java Lexer class, and only if location tracking
     is enabled, position information is extracted using the
     methods "getStartPos" and "getEndPos".
</ul>
WARNING: the parser code is expecting the token to be an integer.
Unlike Java and C, single character constants are not automatically
cast to integers, so the lexer must do that if necessary.  So, for
example, returning 'a' is not the same as returning 97.

<h2 class="break"<a name="Special Features for Use in Python Actions"><u>Special Features for Use in Python Actions</u></a></h2>

The following special constructs are available for use in Python
Actions.  Other analogous C or Java action features are currently
unavailable for Python.
<ul>
<li> Variable: $N <br>
     The semantic value for the Nth component of the current rule.
     This may not be assigned to.
<li> Variable: $$ <br>
     The semantic value for the grouping made by the current rule.
<li> Variable: @N <br>
     The location information of the Nth component of the current rule.
     This may not be assigned to.
<li> Variable: @$ <br>
     The location information of the grouping made by the current rule.
<li> Statement: return YYABORT <br>
     Return immediately from the parser, indicating failure.
<li> Statement: return YYACCEPT <br>
     Return immediately from the parser, indicating success.
<li> Statement: return YYERROR<br>
     Start error recovery (without printing an error message).
</ul>

<h2 class="break"><a name="Python Push Parser Interface"><u>Python Push Parser Interface</u></a></h2>

Normally, Bison generates a pull parser for Python.  The following
Bison declaration says that you want the parser to be a push parser
<quote>%define api.push-pull push</quote>.
Most of the discussion about the Python pull Parser Interface,
applies to the push parser interface as well.
<p>
When generating a push parser, the method "YYParser.push_parse" is created
with the following signature (depending on if locations are enabled).
<pre>
def push_parse(token, lval [, location]):
</pre>
The "token" is an integer matching one of the defined token
constants.  The "lval" is the associated value; use "None" if there
is no value.  The parameter "location" will be defined only if
location tracking is enabled.
<p>
The primary difference with respect to a pull parser is that the
parser method "push_parse" is invoked repeatedly to parse each token.
This function is available if either the "%define api.push-pull push" or
"%define api.push-pull both" declaration is used.
<p>
The value returned by the "push_parse" method is one of the following
three constants: "YYABORT", "YYACCEPT", or "YYPUSH_MORE".  This new
value, "YYPUSH_MORE", may be returned if more input is required to
finish parsing the grammar.
<p>
If api.push-pull is declared as "both", then the generated parser
class will also implement the "parse" method. This method"s body is a
loop that repeatedly invokes the scanner and then passes the values
obtained from the scanner to the "push_parse" method.
<p>
As with the Java push-parser, there is one additional complication.
Technically, the push parser does not need to know about the scanner
(i.e. an object implementing the "YYParser.Lexer" interface), but it
does need access to the "yyerror" method.  Currently, the "yyerror"
method is defined in the "YYParser.Lexer" interface. Hence, an
implementation of that interface is still required in order to provide
an implementation of "yyerror".  The current approach (and subject to
change) is to require the "YYParser" constructor to be given an object
implementing the "YYParser.Lexer" interface. This object need only
implement the "yyerror" method; the other methods can be stubbed since
they will never be invoked.  The simplest way to do this is to add a
trivial scanner implementation to your grammar file using whatever
implementation of "yyerror" is desired. The following code sample shows
a simple way to accomplish this.
<pre>
%code lexer {
  def yylex () : return (0,None)
  def yyerror (msg) : syst.stderr.write(msg+"\n")
}
</pre>

<h2 class="break"><a name="Differences between C/C++/Java and Python Grammars"><u>Differences between C/C++/Java and Python Grammars</u></a></h2>

The different structure of the Python language forces several
differences between grammars for other languages, and grammars designed
for Python parsers.  This section and the next summarizes these differences.
<ul>
<li> Python lacks a preprocessor, so the "YYERROR",
     "YYACCEPT", "YYABORT" symbols obviously cannot be
     macros.  Instead, they should be preceded by "return"
     when they appear in an action.  The actual definition
     of these symbols is opaque to the Bison grammar, and it
     might change in the future.  The only meaningful
     operation that you can do, is to return them.  Note
     that of these three symbols, only "YYACCEPT" and
     "YYABORT" will cause a return from the "yyparse" method.
<p>
<li> Python is dynamically typed, so "%union", "%type", and
     angle brackets on "%token", "type", "$N" and "$$" have
     no consequences for the generated code. But typing of
     terminals and non-terminals may still be useful to help
     bison to do some type checking.
<p>
<li> Python supports exceptions, but there is no way to specify the
     exceptions raised by a function. So, any exception related
     directive is ignored.
</ul>
<p>
The most important difference concerns how user defined actions are
handled. In C,C++, and Java, a switch statement is used.  Python,
however,  does not (yet) contain a "switch" statement.  It is simulated
in a somewhat clumsy fashion as follows.  The basic idea is that each
user action is embedded in a function called yycase_<n>
, for example,
where <n> is the associated yyn index in "yyaction()". A dictionary,
"yyswitch", is setup where each key,value pair is {<n>, yycase_<n>}.
This allows the yyaction() procedure to use yyn to probe the dictionary
(in o(1) time) and execute the corresponding yycase_<n> function.
Note that the "yycase_<n> procedures are defined within the YYParser class
so that "self" is available.
<p>
The complication is that the user-defined action can modify the "$$""
value in its code. The "$$" value is actually a reference to the variable
"yyval". So, somehow, the final value of $$ must be passed out of the
user"s action code.
<p>
In order to make this work, it is necessary to rely on a "feature"
of python function calls.  This feature is that passing a mutable
object into a function as an argument allows the body of that function
to modify that mutable argument.
<p>
So, the solution is to define a python helper class, YYLVAL, defined
as follows:
<pre>
  class YYVAL:
    def __init__(self, yyval) : self.yyval = yyval
</pre>
Assuming the yyvalp argument is an instance of  YYVAL, we get the
following code sequence for a user action.
<pre>
def yycase_<n> (self, yyvalp, yyn, yystack, yylen, yyerror, yyloc) :
  yyval = yyvalp.yyval
  try :
    <user"s action code with braces removed and indented 4 spaces>
  finally :
    yyvalp.yyval = yyval
#end yycase_<n>
...
yyswitch[<n>] = yycase_<n>
</pre>
Remember that this function may return something like YYABORT if the
user code does such a return statement. For this reason, the user"s
code is wrapped in a "try:...finally:..." to ensure that yyval is
always properly stored.  Also note that if "%locations" is not defined,
the the "yyloc" argument will not be present.
<p>
The corresponding generic code in "yyaction()" in the parser looks
like this.
<pre>
  if (yyn in self.yyswitch) :
    action = self.yyswitch[yyn]
    yyvalp = YYVAL(yyval)
    status = action(yyvalp, yyn, yystack, yylen, yyloc)
    yyval = yyvalp.yyval
    if(status != None) : return status
    else: # no such action index; ignore
      pass
</pre>
Here, the "yyswitch" dictionary is probed to see if the specified
"yyn" is defined. Assuming so, then the corresponding user code
procedure is extracted.  The current value of yyval is stored in an
instance of YYVAL, and the user action procedure is invoked with all
the necessary arguments. The return result from the user action
procedure is captured. If it is "None", then no return was executed and
yyaction can continue on. If the return status is something like
YYABORT, then an immediate return is executed.
<p>
One last point, since the user code is in its own procedure and is
defined in the YYParser class, the code may need to use python "global"
statements to access module level declarations.

<h2 class="break"><a name="%code Summary"><u>%code Summary</u></a></h2>

The "%code" directive inserts code verbatim into the output parser
source at any of a predefined set of locations.  It thus serves as a
flexible and user-friendly alternative to the traditional Yacc
prologue, "%{CODE%}".  This section summarizes the functionality of
"%code" for Python.
<p>
For any particular qualifier or for the unqualified form, if there
are multiple occurrences of the "%code" directive, Bison concatenates
the specified code in the order in which it appears in the grammar file.
<p>
Not all qualifiers are accepted for Python.  Unaccepted
qualifiers produce an error.
The accepted qualifiers are described here.

<ul>
<li> <i>%code imports {...}</i><br>
     Purpose: This is the best place to write Python
     import directives; it may also be used for copyright notices.
     <p>
     Location(s): For python, it is at the beginning of the module/file.
<p>
<li> <i>%code requires {...}</i><br>
     Purpose: This is the best place to write type
     declarations.
     <p>
     Location(s):  For python, this code is placed just
     after "%code imports".
<p>
<li> <i>%code provides {...}</i><br>
     Purpose: This is the best place to write additional
          definitions and declarations that should be provided to other
          modules.
     <p>
     Location(s): For python, this code is
          placed right after the "%code requires" directives.
<p>
<li> <i>%code top {...}</i><br>
     Purpose: The unqualified "%code" or "%code requires" should
     usually be more appropriate than "%code top".  However,
     occasionally it is necessary to insert code much nearer the
     top of the parser implementation file.
     <p>
     Location(s): For python, this code is placed just before after
     any "%code imports" directives.
<p>
<li> <i>%code {...}</i><br>
     Purpose: Any additional code that must be part of the YYParser class.
     <p>
     Location(s): For python, this code is placed just at the end
     of the YYParser class and properly indented so it is considered part
     of that class.
<p>
<li> <i>%code init { ... }</i><br>
     Purpose: Add code to the constructor.
     <p>
     Location: For python this code is inserted at the beginning of the parser constructor body.
<p>
<li> <i>%% ...</i><br>
     Purpose: The epilogue has the same meaning as in C/C++/Java code and it can
     be used to define other declarations used by the parser.  The epilogue
     code is the last code in the produced python parser file.
     <p>
     Location: For python code following the final %% is inserted at the
     very end of module file and is not indented.
</ul>
<p>
Though we say the insertion locations are language-dependent, they
are technically skeleton-dependent. The python skeleton has been written
to choose its locations consistently with the behavior of
the standard Bison skeletons.

<h2 class="break"><a name="Misc. Directives"><u>Miscellaneous Directives</u></a></h2>
The following directives are supported in python with pretty much standard semantics.
<ul>
